# Noir query core

Research-grade, externally unaudited credential gadgets for the query-method
programme. This lane supplies `suite*` and `term*`; operators and expressions
belong to the other lanes.

Use nargo `1.0.0-beta.21` and bb `5.0.0-nightly.20260324`. Run `nargo test`
here. Nargo manifests constrain the numeric release because this compiler
rejects prerelease version requirements. The live Rust test checks the exact beta
and compiler commit, and the toolchain workflow pins the binaries. Git dependencies
are pinned by tag. Hashing and
Schnorr verification reuse the existing compose core; older methods are unchanged.

See [suite usage](../../../skills/merkle-credentials/SKILL.md) for constructors,
key-checked cells and the public-value contract. Raw term openings are entry-point
witnesses; `TermCell` and `KeyCheckedCell` are internal validated values produced
by the constructors, not ABI witness types.

Hidden credential mode has public issuer-key coordinates and agreed configuration
digest halves, and no public output. Revealed mode has public agreed configuration
digest halves and outputs the salted signed message. Neither exposes the tree
salt, unsalted quad hashes or the root. Salt is a canonical private field element.

The detached evaluator's SHA-256 module remains a frozen second copy. The new
Rust suite owns the source for new callers and pins all Noir globals.

The expression modules expose `(Lane<T>, is_error)`, with a distinct capacity
channel. Call `filter_accept` at a FILTER root. The term-opening contract binds
scalar values to authenticated lexical openings and recomputed keys.
